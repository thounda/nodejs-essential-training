# nodejs-essential-training

Node.js is a powerful tool for controlling servers, building web applications, and creating event-driven programs. And it takes JavaScript—a language familiar to all web developers—out of the browser. With Node.js, you can build applications that run on your laptop or even the cloud. The the (chapter) sets of files in this repository can be used to learn the essentials of Node.js and start creating your own JavaScript applications. The goal with the contents in this repository is to work with the Node.js core, which includes standard input, standard output, the module system, the file system, and how to write and run JavaScript on the server.
